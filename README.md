# Raids death indicator
This plugin calculates the internal fraction and uses that to find out what you hit. Marks the NPCs as dead
if it would be, can be inaccurate when it is not calibrated. Once calibrated it should be accurate.

See [Docs](./docs.md) for how it works.

Known issues
--
If boss health overlay isn't enabled and set to exact hp, the plugin will not be 100% accurate at Akkha,
even when calibrated.
